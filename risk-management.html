<hr></hr>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;">
Ensuring that a company has its finger on the pulse of changing laws and regulations can help proactively steer that organization onto a successful and fruitful path. Effective technology, widespread organizational standards, and continuous education will help set a positive and rewarding culture of compliance across a company and competitive advantage over industry peers.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;">
Compliance training is the method of educating employees on the laws, regulations, and internal corporate policies and procedures that apply to their daily roles. Many legal problems originate from employees acting improperly out of ignorance, misunderstanding, or a blatant disrespect of the laws, regulations, and policies that govern their daily job responsibilities. Many of these problems can be avoided — or at least mitigated — through compliance training.<br><br>

The key objectives of compliance training are to:
Ensure that employees are aware of their compliance responsibilities
Mitigate the risk of compliance breaches
Encourage a better workplace culture
Remove legal liability from the organization in the event of wrongdoing
Protect the organization’s reputation.
Creating knowledgeable, productive employees</P>

<p align="center" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:19px;letter-spacing:2px;">
<font color="#000000"><b>RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT EMPLOYEES WHO RECEIVE COMPLIANCE TRAINING...</b></font></p>

<hr></hr>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;">
Research has shown that employees who receive compliance training are more productive, have lower turnover rates, are more efficient, and need less supervision. While most employees will have an understanding of the types of workplace conduct that are obviously improper, many legal and policy requirements are not obvious or may run counter to some employees' social or cultural norms.<br><br>

Likewise, there are many subtleties in the laws related to anti-competitive conduct, data privacy, insider trading, and similar workplace issues that go beyond a common-sense understanding. Requiring all employees to receive training regularly on their compliance responsibilities gives everyone an active role in creating and maintaining a productive, ethical, and respectful workplace.</p>

<font color="#000000"><b>GOOD ETHICS IS GOOD BUSINESS.</b></font></p>

<hr></hr>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;">
An organization's commitment to the specifics of its own compliance program and training plan can yield meaningful benefits. One study found that every extra dollar allocated to an organization's compliance budget "decreased damages, settlements and fines by $1.37" on average. Another found that organizations investing an above-average amount on training would have returned 45% more than the S&P 500 index during the period studied.<br><br>

Active enforcement of a compliance training plan could well determine how – or whether – law-enforcement authorities pursue a claim of wrongdoing against the organization and/or its officers and employees.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;">
Establishing a compliance training culture in today’s environment means dealing with ever-changing regulatory requirements, greater scrutiny from regulatory bodies, an increasingly mobile workforce, and shrinking developmental budgets. With regulators citing lack of training and understanding as reasons behind compliance failings, organizations are under increasing pressure to deliver accurate, engaging, and cost-effective training, while also demonstrating understanding and completion.</p>
