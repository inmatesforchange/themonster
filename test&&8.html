WEBSITE DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT
A restaurant or foodservice brand’s website is the cornerstone of their digital marketing effort. A modern web presence needs to be mobile-friendly, optimized for search engines, communicate the brand’s message and personality as well as perform marketing functions like driving registrations to marketing platforms or online ordering systems. MPP’s digital team are experts in modern web development and can design, develop and manage an effective website for your brand.


Did you know about our Community Partners Program? Through our CPP, we're building mutually beneficial and strategic alliances. Support us in our mission while adding value to your company’s marketing and brand-building efforts. 

the website can serve as an extension of your business card, with information about you, your business, and services offered. Most important, your website should detail your background, experience, and other credentials to give you credibility and give potential customers more confidence when deciding whether or not to deal with you.

The first step is to decide what your website is going to do for you. It may be fairly static (i.e., no new content added periodically) and simply provide more information to potential clients about your services and credentials if they want to check you out online. Or, you may want to use it for information about your company and provide articles or information you've written to provide useful information to clients and potential clients.

THE RETURNING CITIZEN.<br>

Michelle Jones, our Founder, began the process of seeking meaningful and gainful employment as soon as her release from the Logan Correctional facility in August 2014. she began creating her own job readiness training program in late September 2015. And because she had been enrolled in three well-known job readiness training programs, she knew that she would not make the same mistakes she encountered by administrators and instructors of these programs when building Spiral Group.<br><br>

Her goal was to develop training modules pertinent to employment preparation and shorten the length of job readiness training, considerably. After many months of painstaking research; the development and subsequent revision of training modules; and the creation of a comprehensive website, in April 2016, Spiral Group, Inc. and SpiralGroup.org were born.<br><br>

<p align="left" style="color:#000000;letter-spacing:.5px;">
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU HAD A CLEAR PICTURE OF HOW YOUR COMPANY WAS PERFORMING IN THE MARKETPLACE? Major corporations and consumers value companies that can meet their specialized needs. This is a great time for entrepreneurs to take advantage of opportunities to solve many stressful problems that . We work with you to build a company that can support the specialized needs of this growing market.<br><br>

Determining the strengths of your business, its opportunities for growth, and how it performs against competitors doesn't have to be challenging.<br><br>

According to Google, 97% of consumers use the web to search for local businesses – and if the vast majority of your potential customers are online, you should be, too. Having a strong online presence is a crucial component of your marketing strategy, no matter what size your business is or what industry it belongs to.

An online presence is important for outbound marketing because it reinforces your brand and what you offer to your target market. Once you’ve communicated with your audience, you’ll need to have a web presence that helps portray why your product or service is so great – because that’s the next stop for the majority of your potential customers.

It’s also vital for inbound marketing, because quality online content will help attract customers even if they haven’t heard of your brand.


your website...
All businesses, no matter how small, should have a website. It can be extremely basic, but it should contain the fundamental information customers – both existing and potential – need. For example, one frustration I encounter far too often is restaurants that don’t have a website with a current menu, opening hours, location and contact information. I know I’m not alone in that if I can’t find these details, I’m less likely to visit the restaurant – but there’s no reason a business should lose potential customers over something that’s so easy to remedy and costs very little.

If you’re starting from scratch and not sure what your website should include, survey your existing customers. Whether you send out an email asking for their input, or mention it casually while making their coffee, it’s the best way to get the insight you need – people love to be involved and share their opinions.

Search engine optimization
Once you have a website, it’s vital that it can actually be found by search engines. After all, 89 percent of consumers use search engines to research a product, service or business before making a decision. To take advantage of this, you need to make sure to look at search engine optimization (SEO) for your website.

In case you’re not completely sure what SEO means, how it works, or why it’s important, here’s a quick rundown:

What: The purpose of SEO is to make it easy for search engines to find your website and list it in their ‘organic’ (as opposed to ‘paid’) results.
Why: People tend to trust search engines, so websites that appear high in results pages are more likely to receive traffic.
How: Using search-engine friendly methods to improve your website.
Who: Everyone – anyone who has information that people want to find on the internet should be using SEO techniques.
When: All the time – SEO is an ongoing process. It’s important to monitor the information on your website and make sure it’s current and correct. Search engines also love new content, which is why starting a blog can do wonders for your SEO.
Where: Major search engines include Google, Yahoo and Bing. They connect people all over the world to the content they desire, from products to services to information.

Social media
Social media is an important part of your online presence that improves your chances of generating additional revenue and building customer loyalty. It allows customers, potential customers and other interested parties to engage easily via a channel that plays an important role in their everyday lives.

Although not every social media channel will be relevant to each business, it’s definitely worth looking into your options. For example, Facebook and Twitter will serve a purpose for almost any business – it’s a great place to post news, tips, photos and videos and ask and answer questions.

In addition to Facebook and Twitter, you might find Instagram, Google+, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr, FourSquare helpful. Make sure to research available channels and find out if they will work for you. Instagram, for example, is a photo-sharing network, so it works wonderfully for businesses selling ‘beautiful’ products such as jewelry, food or housewares. It’s important to consider your target demographic – Instagram has around 130–150 million users, over two-thirds of which are women between the ages of 18 and 35. With Instagram, you’ll also need to keep a smartphone handy to properly access your account and engage with your audience.

Once you’ve decided which social media channels to use, get a clear idea of the kind of content you can share. The more compelling and engaging your material is, the more likely your followers will like, comment and share your posts. Engagement is key to promoting your brand – not only will it make you more appealing to existing customers, the more positive social activity that goes on, the higher the chance is that their friends will be exposed to your brand and intrigued by what you have to offer.

When they do this, they’re engaging with your brand and their networks (friends, family, colleagues) are seeing that engagement and may be prompted to check you out for their own needs.
