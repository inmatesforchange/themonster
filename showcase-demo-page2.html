<b>SPIRAL GROUP'S INCEPTION</b></p>

<p align="left" style="font-family:ubuntu;font-size:15px;color:#585858;letter-spacing:.5px;">
Michelle Jones, our Founder, began the process of seeking meaningful and gainful employment as soon as her release from the Logan Correctional facility in August 2014. However, because of the parole restrictions and other prohibitive stipulations set forth by the parole board, her quest for immediate employment was short-lived. The numerous ineffective and time consuming activities required by the parole board caused her to become despondent and she thought about reoffending on a few occasions.<br><br>

In addition, she was placed in a recovery home due to homelessness. This is a standard practice for people who have been released from jail or prison and have no other housing options -whether or not recovery is required. The first recovery home, Hardin House located on Chicago's southside, was consumed with bedbugs, brown and white cockroaches, lice, mice, rats, and live mold. The ceiling in the bathroom on the first level had caved in while she was a resident there. Causing the contents of the flushed toilet on the second level to drain into the first floor's bathroom.<br><br>

Daliy meetings - NA, AA, CA, and PA - were required for everyone to attend. Whether they abused narcotics, alcohol, or cocaine. Even if you had no previous experience as a prostitute, residents had to attend these mandatory meetings and listen to the ridiculously candid testimonies of anyone willing to "anonymously" share secrets of heinous acts and sycophancy that should be taken to their graves. Needless to say, Michelle had been restricted to a recovery environment that was not conducive to recovery at all.<br><br>

As a result, on November 2, 2014, just three months after her release, Michelle and her parole agent decided that she be placed in a different recovery environment. One that would allow her to flourish and experience some semblance of recovery from the stalking and electronic harassment she incessantly endured by Joe Soto of V103 and Clear Channel, which lead to her 2.5 year incarceration. The place was the Gateway Kedzie House, located on Chicago's northwest side. After exposure to recovery-related activities at the second recovery home, Michelle began rebuilding her life from within and imagining how she could utilize her skills and previous work and life experiences to make a necessary contribution to society. She decided to return to the hospitality industry as either a manager, operations consultant, or trainer. This meant she had to regain the industry’s required certifications. So, she set out to do just that.<br><br>

Michelle was encouraged by her peers to seek the support and resources that Re-Entry programs provide. Most of these programs are funded by the government, and are supposed to assist the returning citizen (ex-offender) with successful re-entry back into society. These programs are, according to their mission and vision statements, structured to reduce an inclination toward recidivism. The first program Michelle attended was a 5-day job readiness training program at the Safer Foundation. Unfortunately, the Safer Foundation did not assist Michelle with obtaining meaningful employment. She soon realized that her previous work experience was a bit much for one of the job readiness instructors. Most of her work experience was challenged, negated, and belittled by the instructor. She was adamant about NOT including Michelle's work experience and skill set on the resume she lackadasically compiled for Michelle. In one of the classes, the instructor realized that Michelle had more experience than she.<br><br>

Nevertheless, since Michelle had lost everything as a result of her incarceration because she was the victim of Joe Soto of V103, she used the resume and began to build it until it reflected her entire skill set and work history.<br><br>

<a href="https://github.com/spiralgroup/themonster/issues/1#issuecomment-416069892">CLICK HERE TO READ ABOUT THE ABUSE MICHELLE AND OTHERS ENDURED WHILE A RESIDENT AT TABITHA HOUSE LOCATED ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE.</a> NO. NO ONE EVER DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT.<br><br> 

the way back into Michelle attended free classes and regained her Food Safety Manager’s certifications for both the city of Chicago and state of Illinois on March 20, 2015. But, being a high achiever, she didn’t stop there. She became a certified ServSafe Instructor a few months later. In April 2015, Michelle began her job seeking quest, again. But to no avail. She believed the gaps in her work history, reflected on her resume, disqualified her from the managerial job opportunities for which she applied.<br><br>

In June 2015,she enrolled in a third job readiness training program—one that seemed better suited to her career goals, as a result. However, after a few days of attendance, Michelle realized she was becoming disillusioned. The items highlighted in the program’s flyer, those that piqued her interest, were well out of reach. In addition, the instructor resigned a few weeks later due to lack of pay (the government monies on which the program depended to operate were cut).<br><br>

Nevertheless, Michelle saw the instructor’s resignation as a Divine Opportunity, and convinced the program’s executive
director to allow her to fill in for the instructor—for free. After three weeks without pay, she began receiving $100 per
week as an intern instructor for approximately five weeks. She assisted many of the program’s participants with
acquiring their food handler’s certifications.<br><br>

During this time, Michelle was learning a lot about how the NFP operated, and began dreaming of having her own NFP one day. After a mutual decision to depart from the organization that gave her the chance to be an intern instructor, she began creating her own job readiness training program in late September 2015. And because she had been enrolled in three well-known job readiness training programs, she knew that she would not make the same mistakes she encountered by administrators and instructors when building Spiral Group.<br><br>

Her goal was to develop training modules pertinent to employment preparation and shorten the length of job readiness training, considerably. After many months of painstaking research; the development and subsequent revision of training modules; and the creation of a comprehensive website, in April 2016, Spiral Group, Inc. and SpiralGroup.org were born.<br><br>
