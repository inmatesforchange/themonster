Receive your Food Service Sanitation Manager Certification (FSSMC) with Spiral Group, Inc., and trust ServSafe&#151;the only food safety program with roots in the foodservice industry to help you protect customer health, improve employee performance, and preserve your business reputation.<br><br>

An FSSMC is required by Section 750.540 of the Illinois Food Service Sanitation Code, based on a food service establishment’s risk category assigned by the local health department.<br><br>

Preparing food for others is a big responsibility. The steps you follow, or neglect to follow, can adversely affect other people’s health and wellness. Consumers trust that the food they are served in your food and/or retail establishment is safe to eat. In this class, you will learn how to properly prepare and serve food so that you can maintain that trust.<br><br>

In the ServSafe Food Protection Manager class, conducted by a Certified ServSafe Instructor, managers learn to implement essential food safety practices and create a culture of food safety. All content and materials are based on actual job tasks identified by foodservice industry experts. The information imparted to food service managers in this program is based on the FDA food code, food safety research, and years of food sanitation training experience. The program is designed and facilitated to provide sufficient food safety knowledge to protect the public from foodborne illness.<br><br>

The National Restaurant Association (NRA) ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certification program provides high quality food safety examination materials for the restaurant and food service industry. The ServSafe program is recognized and accepted by more federal, state, and local jurisdictions than any other food safety program. The NRA has awarded more than three million ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certifications.<br><br>

This course presents the characteristics and application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), a risk prevention management methodology that applies appropriate science and technology to plan, control, and document safe food processes in a food facility, consistent with the FDA's desire to implement voluntary HACCP.<br><br>

The course first examines HACCP's principles and concepts. The HACCP approach begins by identifying biological, chemical, and physical hazards (inputs to the system) associated with facility construction, equipment, employees, food and supplies. For prerequisite processes (e.g., personnel hygiene and training; equipment and facility cleaning, sanitizing, and maintenance; receiving and storage); and for food processes (e.g., cooking, hot and cold holding, and cooling), this course presents scientifically validated hazard control procedures that prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to levels that protect public health. Finally, this course describes how HACCP is applied through Active Managerial Control (AMC) to establish a functional food safety management system.<br><br>

<b>After completing this course, the student will be able to:</b><br>

<i class="fa fa-chrome fa-spin" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Identify the biological the food offered to consumers in a food system.<br>

<b>Harassment & Discrimination</b><br>
This course will provide employees with relevant and useful information on employee rights within the workplace. In addition to examining an employee's right to fair and equal consideration and treatment, the course covers pertinent federal laws on job discrimination, processes for reporting discrimination or harassment, and procedures for filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).<br><br>

This course addresses the impact of sexual harassment in the workplace. Because sexual harassment consists of unwanted and unwelcome sexual advances or sexual conduct that has the effect of unreasonably interfering with a person's work performance, this type of behavior can create an intimidating or hostile work environ¬ment. The goal of eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace must begin with prevention. To accomplish this goal, this course will help you identify situations and behaviors that could be perceived as sexual harassment and to apply specific strategies for preventing and eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace.<br><br>

This course begins with the topic of sexual harassment in the workplace, which is illegal. In this course you will learn about some of the misconceptions associated with sexual harassment and how best to handle situations in which you are being harassed. Next, this course discusses the topics of quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile environments. In this course you will learn what quid pro quo sexual harassment is and how hostile environments are created, with tips on creating a sexual harassment policy that will lessen the chances of either form of harassment occurring. In addition, this course introduces the concept of discrimination in the workplace. As you will learn, it is illegal to discriminate against employees and prospective employees in the workplace. There are eight different types of discrimination, all of which you will learn about in this course. This course also details the Americans with Disabilities Act, which outlines the workplace rights of Americans with disabilities. In this course, you will learn what constitutes a disability as outlined by the ADA and you will learn about various types of disabilities. This course will also help you determine when accommodations should be made for a disabled employee.<br><br>
