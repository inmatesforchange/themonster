FACILITY INSPECTIONS: 
Prior to receiving a license the premises must first pass a public health inspection that focuses on food handling practices, product temperature, personal hygiene, facility maintenance and pest control. A menu of proposed food items must be available at time of onsite inspection for review by the CDPH Sanitarian.



Inspection FAILURE: When sanitary requirements are not met a detailed inspection report will be issued to the applicant detailing all violations and/or deficiencies. 




Inspection APPROVAL: When all vital sanitary requirements are met, the CDPH Sanitarian will provide an approval sign to the applicant for posting. The site will also be issued a „risk assessment‟ that will determine future inspection frequency.<br><br>

The ServSafe Food Handler Certificate verifies basic food safety knowledge and is for individuals in food handler employee-level positions. Upon successful completion of the ANSI ASTM 2659 accredited Food Handler course and 40-question assessment, the employee will receive a Certificate of Achievement from the National Restaurant Association that can be printed from a secure section of the ServSafe website.<br><br>

The ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certification verifies that a manager, or person-in-charge, has sufficient food safety knowledge to protect the public from foodborne illness. Individuals that successfully pass the 90-question, multiple-choice exam will receive a ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certification. The ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certification is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) under the Conference for Food Protection Standards.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;"><b>COURSE DESCRIPTION</b><br>
This course presents the characteristics and application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), a risk prevention management methodology that applies appropriate science and technology to plan, control, and document safe food processes in a food facility, consistent with the FDA's desire to implement voluntary HACCP.<br><br>

The course first examines HACCP's principles and concepts. The HACCP approach begins by identifying biological, chemical, and physical hazards (inputs to the system) associated with facility construction, equipment, employees, food and supplies. For prerequisite processes (e.g., personnel hygiene and training; equipment and facility cleaning, sanitizing, and maintenance; receiving and storage); and for food processes (e.g., cooking, hot and cold holding, and cooling), this course presents scientifically validated hazard control procedures that prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to levels that protect public health. Finally, this course describes how HACCP is applied through Active Managerial Control (AMC) to establish a functional food safety management system.<br><br>

<b>After completing this course, the student will be able to:</b><br>

<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Identify the biological the food offered to consumers in a food system.<br>

<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Write a that provides an appropriate level of protection for customers.<br>
