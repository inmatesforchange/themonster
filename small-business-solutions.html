Every organization in the food industry is subject to regular health inspections conducted by local government health departments. These inspections are designed to measure a food establishment's sanitation. If conditions are found to be unsanitary, they can pose a serious health risk to potential customers.<br><br>

<b>DISCOVER THE SPIRAL GROUP DIFFERENCE</b><br>
We prepare you for an official Chicago Health Department Inspection. We work closely with our clients to ensure food safety by reviewing your last health inspection report and developing a strategy that will increase the possibility of your food establishment receiving a higher grade. We also train your food service workers to consistently prevent &ast;The Most Common Health Code Violations.<br><br>   

<b>FOOD SAFETY PROGRAM</b><br>
Included with the Mock Health Inspection is a customized HACCP plan. We create and assist with the implementation of the HACCP plan for your restaurant based on your operations. The HACCP plan is mandatory documentation, according to the FDA and USDA.<br><br>

<b>CLEANING & MAINTENANCE PROGRAM</b><br>
Food service establishments must adhere to a proper cleaning and maintenance schedule to prevent conditions that can lead to the entry and nesting of pests. We assist with the development and implementation of a comprehensive Cleaning & Maintenance Program based on your food establishment's hours of operation and peak/non-peak periods.<br><br>

<b>HOW MUCH WILL YOU HAVE TO INVEST FOR MOCK HEALTH INSPECTION?</b><br>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tasks" style="font-size:12px;"></span> Missing Food Service Sanitation Manager Certificate. The Health Code requires every food service establishment to employ a supervisor of food operations who has a Health Department FSSM Certificate.<br><br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tasks" style="font-size:12px;"></span> Holding food at unsafe temperatures. The Health Code requires food service establishments to keep potentially hazardous food at safe temperatures. Although there are some exceptions, there are two options. Either 1. food can be kept below 41 or above 140 degrees Fahrenheit; or 2. food can be kept at room temperature for "brief periods" if the establishment monitors the time and temperature using time as a Public Health Control.<br><br>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tasks" style="font-size:12px;"></span> Food not protected from chemical, physical, and biological contaminants. 
The Health Code requires food service establishments to protect food from contamination during food storage, preparation, transportation, and display. Surfaces must be smooth and free from paint, rust, stains, or anything that can contaminate food and make it difficult to see whether the surface has been thoroughly cleaned.<br><br>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tasks" style="font-size:12px;"></span> Food Contact Surfaces NOT Prpoperly Cleaned & Sanitized. The Health Code requires food service establishments to keep food contact surfaces clean and sanitized to prevent contamination. Surfaces such as cutting boards, utensils, deli meat slicers, and mixing bowls, must be cleaned and sanitized after each use or following any activity where contamination may have occurred to prevent contamination and cross-contamination. In addition, equipment must be made of materials that are easily cleaned [and sanitized if required] and movable so that the surfaces, equipment, and the areas around them can be cleaned routinely.<br><br>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-tasks" style="font-size:12px;"></span> Lack of Overall Cleanliness Due to Improper Maintenance. The Health Code requires food service establishments to keep those surfaces and areas that do not come in contact with food. To ensure overall cleanliness, the food service establishment must adhere to a proper cleaning and maintenance schedule. Adhering to an effective cleaning and maintenance program will likely prevent conditions that can lead to the entry and nesting of pests.</p>

A food handler, or food employee, is an individual working with unpackaged food, food equipment or utensils, or food-contact surfaces. As of July 1, 2014, Section 750.570 of the Illinois Food Service Sanitation Code requires food handler training in certain conditions.<br><br>

In this class, you will learn how to properly prepare and serve food. The information imparted to food service workers in this program is based on the FDA food code, and is meant to provide basic guidelines for safe food handling. This course has no official prerequisite and may be completed by any individual that seeks knowledge of basic, safe food handling procedures.<br><br>

Classes are available in English, Spanish, and Chinese. The Food Handler Assessment is taken online for immediate results and same day certificate. Computers or tablets must be provided.<br><br>

The ServSafe Food Handler Certificate verifies basic food safety knowledge and is for individuals in food handler employee-level positions. Upon successful completion of the ANSI ASTM 2659 accredited Food Handler course and 40-question assessment, the employee will receive a Certificate of Achievement from the National Restaurant Association that can be printed from a secure section of the ServSafe website.<br><br>

The ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certification verifies that a manager, or person-in-charge, has sufficient food safety knowledge to protect the public from foodborne illness.

This course presents the characteristics and application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), a risk prevention management methodology that applies appropriate science and technology to plan, control, and document safe food processes in a food facility, consistent with the FDA's desire to implement voluntary HACCP.<br><br>

The course first examines HACCP's principles and concepts. The HACCP approach begins by identifying biological, chemical, and physical hazards (inputs to the system) associated with facility construction, equipment, employees, food and supplies. For prerequisite processes (e.g., personnel hygiene and training; equipment and facility cleaning, sanitizing, and maintenance; receiving and storage); and for food processes (e.g., cooking, hot and cold holding, and cooling), this course presents scientifically validated hazard control procedures that prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to levels that protect public health. Finally, this course describes how HACCP is applied through Active Managerial Control (AMC) to establish a functional food safety management system.<br><br>

<b>After completing this course, the student will be able to:</b><br>

<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Identify the biological the food offered to consumers in a food system.<br>
<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Determine which hazards are significant risks.<br>
<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Determine, write, and validate adequate controls for those hazards.<br>
<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Write a that provides an appropriate level of protection for customers.<br>
<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Train and supervise employees to perform controls that strive for zero.</p>
