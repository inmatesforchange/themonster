STAFF TRAININGNYC Grade Fixers, Restaurant Inspections
Prepare your staff for the pressure of an official NYC Health Inspection. Your staff is trained quarterly on the most common violations based on recent inspections of restaurants in your area. We drill staff in the violations most relevant to their role at the bar or restaurant. We also familiarize your team with challenging situations like inventory delivery, or accidents during an inspection.
MOCK INSPECTIONNYC Grade Fixers, Restaurant Inspections
Discover what your restaurant would get if you were inspected today. We use the same checklist the inspectors use, including DOH internal documents that dictate how to grade each type of violation based on severity.
FOOD SAFETY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMNYC Grade Fixers, Restaurant Inspections
A Hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) document is mandatory according to the FDA and USDA. We create and implement a customized preventive plan for your restaurant based on your facilities.


AVOID THESE COMMON VIOLATIONS AND
GET AN "A" GRADE WITH NYC GRADE FIXERS.
MISSING FOOD PROTECTION CERTIFICATE

The Health Code requires every food service establishment to employ a supervisor of food operations who has a Health Department Food Protection Certificate.
HOLDING FOOD AT UNSAFE TEMPERATURES

The Health Code requires food service establishments to keep potentially hazardous food at safe temperatures. There are two options: food can be kept below 41 or above 140 degrees Fahrenheit, or food can be kept at room temperature for brief periods if the establishment monitors the time and temperature using time as a Public Health Control. There are some exceptions.
FOOD NOT PROTECTED FROM CONTAMINATION

The Health Code requires food service establishments to protect food from contamination during food storage, preparation, transportation and display. The Health Code requires food service establishments to keep surfaces that touch food clean and in a condition that prevents buildup of food material. Surfaces such as cutting boards, utensils, deli meat slicers and mixing bowls, must be cleaned after each use and following any activity where contamination may have occurred. Depending on its use, some contact surfaces must be sanitized to prevent crosscontamination. Surfaces must be kept smooth and free from paint, rust and stains that can contaminate food and make it difficult to see whether the surface has been thoroughly cleaned.
FOOD CONTACT SURFACES NOT PROPERLY CLEANED

The Health Code requires food service establishments to keep surfaces clean, even those surfaces that do not come in contact with food. To ensure proper cleaning, nonfood contact surfaces and equipment must be made of materials that are easily cleaned and movable so that the surfaces, equipment, and the areas around them can be cleaned routinely.
IMPROPER MAINTENANCE OF NON-FOOD CONTACT SURFACES

The Health Code requires food service establishments to be free from roaches, rats, mice and flies and, even when these pests are not present, to maintain an establishment free from the conditions that can lead to pests.


Use this information to train your staff within your own food safety program to operate audit/inspection ready every day.

Does your establishment need an A? Do you have an upcoming Inspection?
Let us review your last inspection and create a strategy with our certified restaurant consultants. We are based in the New York City area. Please fill out the form below.

Our major services are built around training and preparing your restaurant and staff for an imminent inspection. Our mock inspections serve as a type of insurance against the massive revenue losses incurred by a poor health inspection grade. 


FACILITY INSPECTIONS: 
Prior to receiving a license the premises must first pass a public health inspection that focuses on food handling practices, product temperature, personal hygiene, facility maintenance and pest control. A menu of proposed food items must be available at time of onsite inspection for review by the CDPH Sanitarian.



Inspection FAILURE: When sanitary requirements are not met a detailed inspection report will be issued to the applicant detailing all violations and/or deficiencies. 




Inspection APPROVAL: When all vital sanitary requirements are met, the CDPH Sanitarian will provide an approval sign to the applicant for posting. The site will also be issued a „risk assessment‟ that will determine future inspection frequency.<br><br>

The ServSafe Food Handler Certificate verifies basic food safety knowledge and is for individuals in food handler employee-level positions. Upon successful completion of the ANSI ASTM 2659 accredited Food Handler course and 40-question assessment, the employee will receive a Certificate of Achievement from the National Restaurant Association that can be printed from a secure section of the ServSafe website.<br><br>

The ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certification verifies that a manager, or person-in-charge, has sufficient food safety knowledge to protect the public from foodborne illness. Individuals that successfully pass the 90-question, multiple-choice exam will receive a ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certification. The ServSafe Food Protection Manager Certification is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) under the Conference for Food Protection Standards.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;"><b>COURSE DESCRIPTION</b><br>
This course presents the characteristics and application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), a risk prevention management methodology that applies appropriate science and technology to plan, control, and document safe food processes in a food facility, consistent with the FDA's desire to implement voluntary HACCP.<br><br>

The course first examines HACCP's principles and concepts. The HACCP approach begins by identifying biological, chemical, and physical hazards (inputs to the system) associated with facility construction, equipment, employees, food and supplies. For prerequisite processes (e.g., personnel hygiene and training; equipment and facility cleaning, sanitizing, and maintenance; receiving and storage); and for food processes (e.g., cooking, hot and cold holding, and cooling), this course presents scientifically validated hazard control procedures that prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to levels that protect public health. Finally, this course describes how HACCP is applied through Active Managerial Control (AMC) to establish a functional food safety management system.<br><br>

<b>After completing this course, the student will be able to:</b><br>

<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Identify the biological the food offered to consumers in a food system.<br>

<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Determine, write, and validate adequate controls for those hazards.<br>
<i class="fa fa-chrome" style="font-size:20;color:#000000;"></i> Write a that provides an appropriate level of protection for customers.<br>
