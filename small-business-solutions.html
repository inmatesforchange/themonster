<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;"><b>OVERVIEW</b><br>
Every organization in the food industry is subject to regular health inspections conducted by local government health departments. These inspections are designed to measure a food establishment's sanitation. If conditions are found to be unsanitary, they can pose a serious health risk to potential customers.<br><br>

<b>DISCOVER THE SPIRAL GROUP DIFFERENCE</b><br>
We prepare you for an official Chicago Health Department Inspection. We work closely with our clients to ensure food safety by reviewing your last health inspection report and developing a strategy that will increase the possibility of your food establishment receiving a higher grade. We also train your food service workers to consistently prevent the Most Common Health Code Violations. See &quot;The Most Common Health Code Violations&quot; below.<br><br>   

<b>FOOD SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM</b><br>
Included with the Mock Health Inspection is a customized Food Safety Management Program. We create and assist with the implementation of the program for your restaurant based on your operations. We begin by identifying biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with facility construction, equipment, employees, training, food, and supplies. We observe personnel hygiene; equipment and facility cleaning, sanitizing, and maintenance; and receiving and storage. Your Food Safety Management Program will contain procedures that either prevent, eliminate, or reduce the risk of hazards.<br><br>

See &quot;The Benefits from Adhering to a Current Food Safety Management Program&quot; below.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;">
<b>CLEANING & MAINTENANCE PROGRAM</b><br>
Food service establishments must adhere to a proper cleaning and maintenance schedule to prevent conditions that can lead to the entry and nesting of pests. We assist with the development and implementation of a comprehensive Cleaning & Maintenance Program based on your food service establishment's hours of operation and peak/non-peak periods.<br><br>

<b>HOW MUCH WILL YOU HAVE TO INVEST FOR MOCK HEALTH INSPECTION?</b><br>
The cost for a Mock Health Inspection is $129.<br><br>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;"><b>THE MOST COMMON HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS</b><br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-erase" style="font-size:12px;"></span> <b>Not Adhering to Proper Handwashing Procedures.</b> Employees either washing their hands in a sink designated for food preparation, or not washing their hands at all when safe food handling has been interrupted.<br><br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-erase" style="font-size:12px;"></span> <b>Failure to properly label bottles containing chemicals.</b><br><br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-erase" style="font-size:12px;"></span> <b>Missing Food Service Sanitation Manager Certificate.</b> The Health Code requires every food service establishment to employ a supervisor of food operations who has a non-expired Health Department FSSM Certificate.<br><br>
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-erase" style="font-size:12px;"></span> <b>Holding food at unsafe temperatures.</b> The Health Code requires food service establishments to keep potentially hazardous food at safe temperatures. Although there are some exceptions, there are two options. Either 1. food can be kept below 41 or above 140 degrees Fahrenheit; or 2. food can be kept at room temperature for "brief periods" if the establishment monitors the time and temperature using time as a Public Health Control.<br><br>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-erase" style="font-size:12px;"></span> <b>Food not protected from chemical, physical, and biological contaminants.</b> The Health Code requires food service establishments to protect food from contamination during food storage, preparation, transportation, and display. Surfaces must be smooth and free from paint, rust, stains, or anything that can contaminate food and make it difficult to see whether the surface has been thoroughly cleaned.<br><br>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-erase" style="font-size:12px;"></span> <b>Food Contact Surfaces NOT Prpoperly Cleaned & Sanitized.</b> The Health Code requires food service establishments to keep food contact surfaces clean and sanitized to prevent contamination. Surfaces such as, cutting boards, utensils, deli meat slicers, and mixing bowls must be cleaned and sanitized after each use or following any activity where contamination may have occurred to prevent contamination and cross-contamination. In addition, equipment must be made of materials that are easily cleaned [and sanitized if required] and movable so that the surfaces, equipment, and the areas around them can be cleaned routinely.<br><br>

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-erase" style="font-size:12px;"></span> <b>Lack of Overall Cleanliness Due to Improper Maintenance.</b> The Health Code requires food service establishments to keep those surfaces and areas that do not come in contact with food. To ensure overall cleanliness, the food service establishment must adhere to a proper cleaning and maintenance schedule. Adhering to an effective cleaning and maintenance program will likely prevent conditions that can lead to the entry and nesting of pests.</p>
