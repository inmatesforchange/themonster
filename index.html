<p align="justify"><b>Employment Preparation & Managing Your Workplace Performance &#124; Course Description</b><br>
This course presents the characteristics and application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), a risk prevention management methodology that applies appropriate science and technology to plan, control, and document safe food processes in a food facility, consistent with the FDA's desire to implement voluntary HACCP.<br><br>

The course first examines HACCP's principles and concepts. The HACCP approach begins by identifying biological, chemical, and physical hazards (inputs to the system) associated with facility construction, equipment, employees, food and supplies. For prerequisite processes (e.g., personnel hygiene and training; equipment and facility cleaning, sanitizing, and maintenance; receiving and storage); and for food processes (e.g., cooking, hot and cold holding, and cooling), this course presents scientifically validated hazard control procedures that prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to levels that protect public health. Finally, this course describes how HACCP is applied through Active Managerial Control (AMC) to establish a functional food safety management system.<br><br>

After completing this course, the student will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Identify the biological, chemical, and physical hazards in the food offered to consumers in a food system.</li>
<li>Determine which hazards are significant risks.</li>
<li>Determine, write, and validate adequate controls for those hazards.</li>
<li>Write a Food Safety Management Plan that provides an appropriate level of protection for customers.</li>
<li>Train and supervise employees to perform controls that strive for zero customer illness or injury during the life of the business.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Each quiz at the end of each lesson must be passed with a miminum of 80% to proceed to the next.<br><br>

<b>Exams</b><br>
The final exam must be passed successfully with 80% or higher in order to receive your certificate of completion.<br><br>

<b>End Of Course Instructions</b><br>
Upon successful completion of the course, the certificate of completion will be available from the training page.</p>

Harassment & Discrimination, For Employees &#124; Course Description</b><br>
This course will provide employees with relevant and useful information on employee rights within the workplace. In addition to examining an employee's right to fair and equal consideration and treatment, the course covers pertinent federal laws on job discrimination, processes for reporting discrimination or harassment, and procedures for filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).<br><br>

This course addresses the impact of sexual harassment in the workplace. Because sexual harassment consists of unwanted and unwelcome sexual advances or sexual conduct that has the effect of unreasonably interfering with a person's work performance, this type of behavior can create an intimidating or hostile work environ¬ment. The goal of eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace must begin with prevention. To accomplish this goal, this course will help you identify situations and behaviors that could be perceived as sexual harassment and to apply specific strategies for preventing and eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace.<br><br>

This course begins with the topic of sexual harassment in the workplace, which is illegal. In this course you will learn about some of the misconceptions associated with sexual harassment and how best to handle situations in which you are being harassed. Next, this course discusses the topics of quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile environments. In this course you will learn what quid pro quo sexual harassment is and how hostile environments are created, with tips on creating a sexual harassment policy that will lessen the chances of either form of harassment occurring. In addition, this course introduces the concept of discrimination in the workplace. As you will learn, it is illegal to discriminate against employees and prospective employees in the workplace. There are eight different types of discrimination, all of which you will learn about in this course. This course also details the Americans with Disabilities Act, which outlines the workplace rights of Americans with disabilities. In this course, you will learn what constitutes a disability as outlined by the ADA and you will learn about various types of disabilities. This course will also help you determine when accommodations should be made for a disabled employee.</p>

<p align="justify">After completing this course, the student should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Define “sexual harassment,” as outlined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</li>
<li>Summarize common misconceptions associated with sexual harassment.</li>
<li>Identify if your behavior is inappropriate or making others uncomfortable.</li>
<li>Outline how best to approach someone who is harassing you and what should be said to them.</li>
<li>Outline the steps that should be taken if you don't feel comfortable approaching your harasser with your feelings about the situation.</li>
<li>Describe quid pro quo harassment.</li>
<li>Describe some of the attributes of a hostile work environment.</li>
<li>Identify when sexual harassment in the form of quid pro quo or hostile environment is occurring.</li>
<li>Define “discrimination,” as outlined by the law.</li>
<li>List the eight criteria it is illegal to base hiring and firing decisions on in the workplace because it is considered discrimination.</li> <li>Define “disability,” as outlined by the ADA. List types of disabilities.</li>

Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your business, its opportunities for growth and development, and how it performs against competitors doesn’t have to be guesswork.<br><br>

What Would You Do If You Had A Clear Picture of How Your Company Was Performing In The Marketplace?<br><br>

Much of your time is spent delivering stellar products and outstanding services, working with clients, and managing the day to day business. This could mean that less time is spent making strategic decisions on how to grow and further develop your company and increase brand awareness.<br><br>

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25410880/24280338/3d8fe83a-1026-11e7-9243-07e4ece90aa9.jpg" width="400" height="275">

An objective business analysis, coupled with specific recommendations that will enable your organization to achieve its objectives, can be an invaluable business tool. Many small businesses have greater growth potential than is realized.<br><br>

An effective business operations assessment is designed to answer specific questions that progressive business leaders need to know concerning every aspect of the operation.<br><br>

<b>OPERATIONS</b>
How is the company performing? If the company is meeting and/or exceeding its objectives, why?
Is the company underperforming? If so, why?
Are we properly positioning our products and services?
What phase of development is the business currently experiencing, and what needs to be done to cultivate this stage?

<b>SALES & MARKETING</b>

Do we have a marketing plan?
How are sales and marketing activities performing?
Are we tracking our marketing materials to determine effectiveness?
With whom have we chosen to co-brand?
Are we investing enough money, time, energy, and effort into our sales and marketing strategies?
When we roll out a new marketing campaign, are we prepared operationally to meet the demands operationally?<br>
Some examples: If we advertise that we are offering a discount on a product or service, do we have enough of that item in stock? Have we worked out what to do if we experience a glitch when delivering a service? Have our employees been trained to handle and resolve complaints with professionalism and sense of urgency?


<b>COMPETITION</b>
Who are our competitors?
In comparison, are we priced correctly&#151;too high, or too low?
Do we visit our competition to determine if their products and services are comparable?
Do we have a ‘War Room’ (a room where strategic marketing decisions are made) in place in an effort to track our competition’s activities so that we can outmaneuver them?
Have we purchased from our competition to determine the quality of their products and services, and to gauge the customer experience?
Do we know why customers purchase from our competition?
How do our products and services compare to the competition?
Is our competition’s customer base the kind that we want to attract to our business? If so, how do we go about enticing them to become our loyal customers?


HUMAN RESOURCES
Is our staff productive? Do we have the right people, in the right places, at the right times?
Do we recruit new employees?
Do we have current paper applications on hand for people looking to join our team?
Do we spend time conducting mini-interviews with all job applicants?
Do we act with a sense of urgency when we seek to fill an open position?
During the selection process, are we sure about what we seek in an employee?
Do we have an effective onboarding system in place for new hires?
How effective is our training program?
Are we taking advantage of governmental resources available for hiring hard-to-employ individuals?
What are we doing to ensure loyalty and trustworthiness among our employees?


OUR INDUSTRY

What are the trends in my industry? Is it necessary to respond to them? If so, how should we respond?

TECHNOLOGY
Do we have an online presence?
In what ways are we utilizing social media to grow and develop our business?
Are we using the right IT? Software? Cloud services? Are we getting the most out of them?

<b>PROFITABILITY</b>
Are we leveraging our resources to get the greatest return?
How much is the company worth and how can we leverage it?

<b>The Strategic Management Plan</b><br>
Your company’s Strategic Management Plan is comprised of specific recommendations that will assist you with formulating, implementing, and evaluating your functional business decisions, which will enable your organization to achieve its objectives.<br><br>

The Strategic Management Plan is designed to transform the business operations assessment into a realistic timetable of actionable steps that you can take to move your business in a direction to meet company objectives and increase overall profitability. It will provide you with a 360-degree review on your Company&#151;sales, marketing, finances, products and services, HR, management, and processes. Here’s how:

If your goal is to grow your company, your Strategic Management Plan will provide you with timing and direction on how to grow.
If your goal is to stabilize your company, your Strategic Management Plan will reveal which areas to work on and what you should do to increase company stability.
If your goal is to work more efficiently, your Strategic Management Plan will help to define what steps you need to consider taking in order to accomplish this.
