<p align="justify"><b>Employment Preparation & Managing Your Workplace Performance &#124; Course Description</b><br>
This course presents the characteristics and application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), a risk prevention management methodology that applies appropriate science and technology to plan, control, and document safe food processes in a food facility, consistent with the FDA's desire to implement voluntary HACCP.<br><br>

The course first examines HACCP's principles and concepts. The HACCP approach begins by identifying biological, chemical, and physical hazards (inputs to the system) associated with facility construction, equipment, employees, food and supplies. For prerequisite processes (e.g., personnel hygiene and training; equipment and facility cleaning, sanitizing, and maintenance; receiving and storage); and for food processes (e.g., cooking, hot and cold holding, and cooling), this course presents scientifically validated hazard control procedures that prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to levels that protect public health. Finally, this course describes how HACCP is applied through Active Managerial Control (AMC) to establish a functional food safety management system.<br><br>

After completing this course, the student will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Identify the biological, chemical, and physical hazards in the food offered to consumers in a food system.</li>
<li>Determine which hazards are significant risks.</li>
<li>Determine, write, and validate adequate controls for those hazards.</li>
<li>Write a Food Safety Management Plan that provides an appropriate level of protection for customers.</li>
<li>Train and supervise employees to perform controls that strive for zero customer illness or injury during the life of the business.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">Each quiz at the end of each lesson must be passed with a miminum of 80% to proceed to the next.<br><br>

<b>Exams</b><br>
The final exam must be passed successfully with 80% or higher in order to receive your certificate of completion.<br><br>

<b>End Of Course Instructions</b><br>
Upon successful completion of the course, the certificate of completion will be available from the training page.</p>

<b>Subject Matter Expert</b><br>
Michelle Jones has been food safety educator, researcher, and consultant for over 50 years: in the Army, at the University of Minnesota, and as a consultant. His goal is to help operators improve the quality and safety of their operations through better understanding of the processes while simplifying food preparation procedures and reducing cost. As an Army officer, Dr. Snyder commanded Quartermaster field units and developed radiation-sterilized food and microwave systems. While Associate Professor at the University of Minnesota, he began Minnesota's food management HACCP self-control program.<br><br>

Currently, he helps foodservice operators to implement HACCP safety self-control programs while working to standardize retail HACCP. He has lectured in the U.S., Mid-East, Australia, and Europe; has published widely on retail food safety topics such as safe hand washing; and has been an expert witness in foodborne illness and food safety lawsuits.</p>

Harassment & Discrimination, For Employees &#124; Course Description</b><br>
This course will provide employees with relevant and useful information on employee rights within the workplace. In addition to examining an employee's right to fair and equal consideration and treatment, the course covers pertinent federal laws on job discrimination, processes for reporting discrimination or harassment, and procedures for filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).<br><br>

This course addresses the impact of sexual harassment in the workplace. Because sexual harassment consists of unwanted and unwelcome sexual advances or sexual conduct that has the effect of unreasonably interfering with a person's work performance, this type of behavior can create an intimidating or hostile work environ¬ment. The goal of eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace must begin with prevention. To accomplish this goal, this course will help you identify situations and behaviors that could be perceived as sexual harassment and to apply specific strategies for preventing and eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace.<br><br>

This course begins with the topic of sexual harassment in the workplace, which is illegal. In this course you will learn about some of the misconceptions associated with sexual harassment and how best to handle situations in which you are being harassed. Next, this course discusses the topics of quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile environments. In this course you will learn what quid pro quo sexual harassment is and how hostile environments are created, with tips on creating a sexual harassment policy that will lessen the chances of either form of harassment occurring. In addition, this course introduces the concept of discrimination in the workplace. As you will learn, it is illegal to discriminate against employees and prospective employees in the workplace. There are eight different types of discrimination, all of which you will learn about in this course. This course also details the Americans with Disabilities Act, which outlines the workplace rights of Americans with disabilities. In this course, you will learn what constitutes a disability as outlined by the ADA and you will learn about various types of disabilities. This course will also help you determine when accommodations should be made for a disabled employee.</p>
