FOOD SAFETY HACCP FOR RETAIL FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS (16 HOUR) Description
This course presents the characteristics and application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), a risk prevention management methodology that applies appropriate science and technology to plan, control, and document safe food processes in a food facility, consistent with the FDA's desire to implement voluntary HACCP. The course first examines HACCP's principles and concepts. The HACCP approach begins by identifying biological, chemical, and physical hazards (inputs to the system) associated with facility construction, equipment, employees, food and supplies. For prerequisite processes (e.g., personnel hygiene and training; equipment and facility cleaning, sanitizing, and maintenance; receiving and storage); and for food processes (e.g., cooking, hot and cold holding, and cooling), this course presents scientifically validated hazard control procedures that prevent, eliminate, or reduce hazards to levels that protect public health. Finally, this course describes how HACCP is applied through Active Managerial Control (AMC) to establish a functional food safety management system.
After completing this course, the student will be able to: Identify the biological, chemical, and physical hazards in the food offered to consumers in a food system. Determine which hazards are significant risks. Determine, write, and validate adequate controls for those hazards. Write a Food Safety Management Plan that provides an appropriate level of protection for customers. Train and supervise employees to perform controls that strive for zero customer illness or injury during the life of the business. Who Should Take This? Professionals in the food industry. End Of Course Instructions Upon successful completion of the course, the certificate of completion will be available from the training page. Subject Matter Expert Michelle Jones has been food safety educator, researcher, and consultant for over 50 years: in the Army, at the University of Minnesota, and as a consultant. His goal is to help operators improve the quality and safety of their operations through better understanding of the processes while simplifying food preparation procedures and reducing cost. As an Army officer, Dr. Snyder commanded Quartermaster field units and developed radiation-sterilized food and microwave systems. While Associate Professor at the University of Minnesota, he began Minnesota's food management HACCP self-control program. Currently, he helps foodservice operators to implement HACCP safety self-control programs while working to standardize retail HACCP. He has lectured in the U.S., Mid-East, Australia, and Europe; has published widely on retail food safety topics such as safe hand washing; and has been an expert witness in foodborne illness and food safety lawsuits.
