<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;">
While most of your employees will have an understanding of workplace conduct that is improper, some workplace issues go beyond a common sense understanding. Some legal and ethical requirements may not be obvious to your workforce, or may run counter to some of their social or cultural norms.<br><br>

Many legal problems originate from employees acting improperly out of ignorance, misunderstanding, or a blatant disrespect of the laws, regulations, and policies that govern their daily job responsibilities. Active enforcement of an effective compliance and risk mitigation training plan could determine how law-enforcement authorities pursue a claim of wrongdoing against your organization, its officers, and/or employees. Let Spiral Group assist you with laying the groundwork for a partial or complete defense in the event an employee wrongdoing occurs.<br><br>

Today, regulators cite lack of training and understanding as reasons behind compliance failings. This places organizations under pressure to deliver accurate, up-to-date, engaging, and cost-effective training, while demonstrating understanding and completion. Compliance and ethics practices can no longer be viewed as a side function set in place to prevent an organization from experiencing legal troubles. It must become part of the overall business strategy, pervasive throughout the entire organization.<br><br>

Organizations that offer employees compliance training on a wide range of topics experience added business value and a competitive advantage. The key objectives of our compliance training course are to ensure that employees are aware of their compliance responsibilities; to mitigate the risk of compliance breaches; to encourage a better workplace culture; to remove legal liability from the organization in the event of wrongdoing; and to protect the organization’s reputation.</p>

Professionalism is the conduct, aims, or qualities that characterize a professional person&#151;it also implies quality of workmanship or service. A professional reputation is the difference between success and failure, and employers usually seek to retain their most professional team members. Those who exhibit professionalism, even under the most challenging circumstances, will have doors opening for them in the workplace and in their personal ambitions.<br><br>

This course outlines the rules to being professional through the use of Soft Skills. We know that developing Soft Skills is crucial for promoting one’s success in the workplace. Therefore, our goal is to ensure that these skills are properly formulated and that adversarial attitudes toward work have been pragmatically addressed.<br><br>

In this course, students learn how to gain the trust and respect of those confiding in them, and increase their influence within the organization where they are employed. More importantly, we teach students how to apply the golden rules of professionalism so they can enjoy a wonderful, professional, and prosperous career with an employer of choice.<br><br>

<p align="justify" style="font-family:calibri;font-size:16px;letter-spacing:.50px;"><b>COURSE OVERVIEW</b><br>
Employment practices that are considered to be discriminatory involve any biased behavior in employee recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, setting wages and compensation, testing, training, apprenticeships, internships, termination, and various other types of discrimination that are based on these protected classifications.<br><br>

Employment discrimination is likely to occur silently in the beliefs, attitudes, and values that one applies in his mind toward a candidate. Although discriminatory words may never be uttered, one who is prone to discriminate will find a <i>non-discriminatory</i> way to reject the candidate. The goal of eliminating employment discrimination begins with proper identification. To accomplish this, our course will help students identify situations and behaviors that could be perceived as employment discrimination. Once this is accomplished, students will learn how to apply specific strategies for eliminating discriminatory employment practices.<br><br>

We will also examine discrimination against Americans with disabilities. Students will learn what constitutes a disability as outlined by the ADA, and the various types of disabilities. Discrimination laws are enforced by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC also provides oversight, guidelines, and coordination of Federal equal employment opportunity regulations, practices, and policies.<br><br>

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission defines harassment as unwelcome verbal or physical behavior that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), gender/gender identity, nationality, age (40 or older), physical or mental disability or genetic information. Workplace harassment is a form of discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other federal regulations.<br><br>

Workplace harassment isn’t limited to sexual harassment. Harassing conduct may include offensive jokes, slurs, name calling, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, ridicule, insults, offensive pictures, and more. The harasser can be a supervisor, co-worker, or non-employee. Interestingly, the victim doesn't have to be the person being harassed&#151;it can be anyone adversely affected by the harassing behavior.<br><br>

In this course, students will learn how to recognize and address workplace harassment, as well as employ common prevention strategies to keep the workplace free from harassment. They will learn how to analyze their own behavior to ensure it is appropriate at all times, and the importance of promoting a culture of mutual respect in the workplace.<br><br>

If your assumptions about certain groups of people based on things you have heard from others, in school, the media, or the movies; then it is possible that some of your assumptions are incorrect&#151;at least for some people. Oftentimes, some of the beliefs we hold are the result of our cultural conditioning. They determine if we will seek rapport with individuals who are different from us.<br><br>

In this course, students are encouraged to accept that although we are human and will probably make some mistakes, we all need to work to become more aware of your inner thoughts and feelings, and how they affect our beliefs, actions, and inactions. Students are taught to separate the facts from their previously held assumptions, opinions, theories, and suppositions so they can make judgments based only on that which is true. We inspire students to engage in honest dialogue with others about race, which may be difficult, risky, or uncomfortable, and to seek out portrayals of different races that are both realistic and positive.<br><br>

As we gain more awareness and knowledge about groups different than ours, not only will our stereotypes lessen, but we will also become better equipped to educate and challenge others about their stereotypes.</p>
